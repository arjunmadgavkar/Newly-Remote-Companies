# Newly-Remote-Companies
This list tracks changes to companies’ remote work policies since the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to have a single, crowd-sourced source of truth that we can all use. You can also view this list on [LifeShack](https://lifeshack.io/remote).

If you want to add a company to the list, please create a PR with the name of the company, its policy, and a link to the source. If you're not familiar with Git, then [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/thearjunmad) and I'll create a PR on your behalf.
